Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{huffman_8c}{huffman.\+c}} \\*Huffman coding implementation for data compression and decompression }{\pageref{huffman_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{huffman_8h}{huffman.\+h}} \\*Header file which contains declarations for functions and structures related to the Huffman coding program. It includes the main entry point, command\+Line, which parses command-\/line arguments and controls the flow of the program. It also provides the print\+Usage function for displaying correct command-\/line usage. Additionally, the \mbox{\hyperlink{structHuffmanOptions}{Huffman\+Options}} structure is defined to store input/output filenames and options }{\pageref{huffman_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{probability_8c}{probability.\+c}} \\*Implementation file for probability calculations such as getting the Frequencies, calculating the probabilities and implementing the P command, as well as Input/\+Output helper functions }{\pageref{probability_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{probability_8h}{probability.\+h}} \\*Header file containing declarations for probability calculations and file I/O }{\pageref{probability_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{treenode_8c}{treenode.\+c}} \\*Implements data structures and functions for Huffman coding using a Min\+Heap-\/based binary tree }{\pageref{treenode_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{treenode_8h}{treenode.\+h}} \\*Header file which defines structures and functions related to tree nodes and Huffman coding. It includes the definition of the \mbox{\hyperlink{structTreeNode}{Tree\+Node}} structure, representing a node in the Huffman tree, and the \mbox{\hyperlink{structMinHNode}{Min\+HNode}} structure, used for building the Huffman tree with a min-\/heap approach. Various functions are declared for manipulating these structures, including creating nodes, building the Huffman tree, and generating Huffman codes. Additionally it includes declarations for reading probabilities from a file, encoding files, and decoding files, printing arrays and generating and printing Huffman codes }{\pageref{treenode_8h}}{}
