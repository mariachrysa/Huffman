\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structHuffmanOptions}{Huffman\+Options}} \\*Structure to store options for the Huffman coding program. The \mbox{\hyperlink{structHuffmanOptions}{Huffman\+Options}} structure includes pointers to input/output filenames for various program operations }{\pageref{structHuffmanOptions}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structMinHeap}{Min\+Heap}} \\*Structure representing a min-\/heap for Huffman tree construction. It includes information about the size, capacity, and an array of \mbox{\hyperlink{structMinHNode}{Min\+HNode}} pointers }{\pageref{structMinHeap}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structMinHNode}{Min\+HNode}} \\*Structure representing a node in the min-\/heap used for building the Huffman tree }{\pageref{structMinHNode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structProbabilityData}{Probability\+Data}} \\*Structure which maintains an array to store the frequency of each ASCII character }{\pageref{structProbabilityData}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structTreeNode}{Tree\+Node}} \\*Structure which contains information about a node in the Huffman tree, including the character it represents, the associated value or frequency, and pointers to its left and right child nodes }{\pageref{structTreeNode}}{}
